### Purpose 
This is just a demo project created to experiment and get familiar with react native practices and technologies.

### How to use
1. Make sure to [setup your environment with React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
2. You must obtain your own API Key from TMDB. [See how here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).  
3. Then create a file named "secrets.json" in the root folder with the following contents:
```
{
  "tmdbToken": "<Your API Key Here>"
}
```
4. You may now run on ios or android.
